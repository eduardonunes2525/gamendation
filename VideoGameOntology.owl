        <rdfs:comment>Action-adventure games combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. &quot;Action-adventure&quot; has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Action games emphasize physical challenges that require Hand-eye coordination and motor skill to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The action role-playing game or action RPG is a type of role-playing video game which incorporates elements from action games or action-adventure games. The first action role-playing games were produced by Nihon Falcom in the 1980s, such as the Dragon Slayer series and Ys series. Later so-called &quot;Diablo clones&quot; are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character&apos;s development.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Adventure games were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply &quot;Adventure,&quot; and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.


Unlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a &quot;purist&quot; genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a mini game.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Artillery is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually turn-based) computer games involving tanks fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Some RPG give the player several choices in how their story will unfold. Typically the player can have an effect on whether the enemies in the game will be taken out lethally or non-lethally. This is very popular because it makes the player have to deal with the consequences of their own choices whenever they fail to save someone or don&apos;t get the ending they desired, for example. This makes for a much more interactive experience between gamers and gameplay, also explaining their popularity.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Educational games are games explicitly designed with educational purposes, or which have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are games that are designed to help people to learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand a historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. Game types include board, card, and video games. An educational game is a game designed to teach humans about a specific subject and to teach them a skill. As educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits of gaming have on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream. Games are interactive play that teach us goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They satisfy our fundamental need to learn by providing enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction and emotion in the game itself while the learning takes place.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Due to RPG origins with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other pen and paper role-playing games, the most popular setting for RPG by far is a fantasy world, usually with heavy medieval high fantasy influences, with series such as Diablo, Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls and Baldur&apos;s Gate sharing a basic fantasy setting. However, numerous exceptions exist, with some notable examples including the East Asian settings of Far East of Eden and Jade Empire, the steampunk settings of Final Fantasy VI and Grandia, the science fiction settings of Star Ocean, Xeno, Knights of the Old Republic, and Mass Effect, the retro-futuristic setting of Fallout, and the contemporary settings of Mother, Megami Tensei and Alpha Protocol.</rdfs:comment>

Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of mice led to the &quot;point-and-click&quot; genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands.

        <rdfs:comment>The interactive movie genre came about with the invention of laserdiscs. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed full-motion cartoons or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the designers intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use full motion video, FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), also known as &quot;action real-time strategy&quot; (ARTS), is a genre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of real-time strategy, in which a player controls a single character in one of two teams. The objective is to destroy the opposing team&apos;s main structure with the assistance of periodically spawned computer-controlled units that march forward along set paths. Player characters typically have various abilities and advantages that improve over the course of a game and that contribute to a team&apos;s overall strategy. A fusion of action games, role-playing games and real-time strategy games, players usually do not construct either buildings or units. The genre gained popularity in the 2010s as a form of electronic sports, encompassing games such as the Defense of the Ancients mod for Warcraft III, its Valve-developed sequel Dota 2, League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, and Smite.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Metroidvania games (named after its two first well-known franchises, Metroid and Castlevania) feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one&apos;s steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve lots of backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained. Bossfights are also a staple of metroidvanias, without which they would be considered puzzle or adventure games</rdfs:comment>

Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an overworld, usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Sandbox RPG or Open World RPG allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game&apos;s main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Sports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the Fight Night and WWE 2K series.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Sports games emulate the playing of traditional physical sports. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as Championship Manager). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as Arch Rivals). One of the best selling series in this genre is the FIFA (video game series) series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., Pong) and remains popular today.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>These games tend to emphasize subterfuge and precision strikes over the more overt mayhem of shooters, for example, the Metal Gear series, and the Sly Cooper series. In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as Dishonored, the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The tactical role-playing game subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from strategy games as an alternative to traditional RPG systems. Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid. The genre has its origins in tabletop role-playing games, where each player has time to decide his or her characters&apos; actions.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Tower defense games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called creeps move along a set path, and the player must place, or &quot;build&quot; towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.</rdfs:comment>

A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that have been developed either internally by the publisher or externally by a video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product&apos;s manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A visual novel is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with anime-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or tableau vivant stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player&apos;s actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including bishōjo games.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Wargames are a subgenre of strategy video games that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game&apos;s focus is upon military strategy or tactics.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>4X refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. A 4X game can be turn-based or real-time. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is Sid Meier&apos;s Civilization series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species.</rdfs:comment>
